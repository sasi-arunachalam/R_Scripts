This folder has R scripts for doing DESEQ2 from STAR output. Also, I added biomart library to convert ensemble ID to gene names then used those 
input file for DESEQ2 analysis. Having a gene name is more meaningful in plots and other studies.  
Further, i converted raw counts to normalized counts for heatmap and cluster plotting . This is prefreed to FPKM/TPM/PRKM
